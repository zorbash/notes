# Notes

This repo contains reading notes and book highlights.

It's an attempt to make my notes portable, accessible and version controlled.

The `books.json` file is generated by this [script](https://github.com/zorbash/bookworm)
which downloads Kindle highlights.

You can read more about it [here](https://zorbash.com/post/highlights-notes).
