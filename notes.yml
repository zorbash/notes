        A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply
        the activity involved.

        In date-like inspection, all material is held at the "gate" until the inspection
        tests are completed. If the material passes, it is moved on to the next stage in
        production process.

        Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work.
        This is called work simplification. To get leverage this way you first need to create
        a flow chart of the production process as it exists.
        To implement the actual simplification, you must question why each step is performed.

        Delegation is an essential aspect of management. The "delegator" and "delegatee" must
        share a common information base and a a common set of operational ideas or notions
        on how to go about solving problems.

        Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and
        monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result.

        What is the medium of a manager's forecast? It is something very simple: his calendar.

        As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to
        eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many.

        About twenty middle managers at Intel were once asked to be part of an experiment.
        After pairing up, they tried some role-playing in which one manager was to define the
        problem most limiting his output and the other was to be a consultant who would
        analyze the problem and propose solutions.

        Process-Oriented Meetings
        The prople attending should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of substantive
        matters are discussed, and what is to be accomplished.

      text: >
        A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting,
        with its agenda and tone set by him. They should be asked to prepare an outline,
        which is very important becasue it forces them to think through in advance all
        of the issues and points they plan to raise.

        A supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest
        way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting's basic purpose.

        A meeting involving ten managers for two hours costs the company $2000.
        Just as you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment
        worth $2000, you shouldn't let anyone walk away with the time of this fellow managers.

        Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened
        by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made,
        and the actions to be taken. The minutes shoudl also be as clear and as specific
        as possible, telling the reader what is to be done, who is to do it, and when.

        Peter Drucker said that if people spend more thatn 25 percent of their time in
        meetings, it is a sing of malorganization.

        Put another way, even if today's veteran manager was once an outstanding engineer,
        he is not now the technical expert he was when he joined the company.
        At Intel, anyway, we managers get a little more obsolete every day.

        It is very important that everybody voice opinions and beliefs as equals throughout
        the free discussion stage, forgetting or ignoring status differentials.

        Does being without a compass mean being without purpose [discours]?
        Does that make you a chaotic schizophrenic like Deleuze and Guattari claimed?

        Take homosexuality for example. It's considered a disorder within the physical order.
        When we label a disorder as of being within the physical order, then there is only
        one thing that we can do: We must form a lobby. If you form a lobby, you establish
        no longer being a disorder of the physical order. As you know, homosexuality is
        no longer classified as a disorder due to the pressure of an
        aggregation of political forces.

        The subconscious does not exist. The primal subconscious does not exist as knowledge.
        To become knowledge, to convert it into knowledge, it needs love. Lacan said that
        psychoanalysis demands loving your subconscious.

        The matter of psychically ill, or better put, of psychoses has not been addressed
        by antipsychiatry regardless of any delusions cultivated by some local groups.
        Antipsychiatry is a movement striving to free the psychiatrist.

        Where can pleasure nest? What's needed for pleasure? A body. To find pleasure we
        need a body. Even those who promise eternal bliss have to imply that the body will
        move towards it. Glorious or not, it has to be there. There needs to be a body.
        Why? Because the dimension of pleasure for a body is the dimension of descending
        to the underworld.

        The law of the 30th of June 1838 rules that a mentally ill person can be dangerous
        for themselves and others. It's is really odd this introduction of danger where
        social class is based. What is this danger? God knows how free one can be
        in this direction.
