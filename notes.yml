  title: Create Dangerously

      text: >
        To create today is to create dangerously. Any publication is an act, and that
        act exposes one to the passions of an age that forgives nothing.

        A fashionable society in which all troubles were money troubles and all worries
        were sentimental worries was satisfied for decades with its society novelists and
        with the most futile art in the world, the one about which Oscar Wilde, thinking
        of himself before he knew prison, said that the greatest of all vices was
        superficiality.

        The sea, rains, necessity, desire, the struggle against death - there are the things
        that unit us all. We resemble one another in what we see together, in what
        we suffer together.

        There is but one possible realistic film: the one that is constantly shown us
        by an invisible camera on the world's screen. The only realistic artist, then,
        is God, if he exists. All other artists are ipso facto, unfaithful to reality.

        Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work.
        This is called work simplification. To get leverage this way you first need to create
        a flow chart of the production process as it exists.
        To implement the actual simplification, you must question why each step is performed.

        Delegation is an essential aspect of management. The "delegator" and "delegatee" must
        share a common information base and a a common set of operational ideas or notions
        on how to go about solving problems.

        Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and
        monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result.

        As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to
        eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many.

        About twenty middle managers at Intel were once asked to be part of an experiment.
        After pairing up, they tried some role-playing in which one manager was to define the
        problem most limiting his output and the other was to be a consultant who would
        analyze the problem and propose solutions.

        Process-Oriented Meetings
        The prople attending should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of substantive
        matters are discussed, and what is to be accomplished.

      text: >
        A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting,
        with its agenda and tone set by him. They should be asked to prepare an outline,
        which is very important becasue it forces them to think through in advance all
        of the issues and points they plan to raise.

        A meeting involving ten managers for two hours costs the company $2000.
        Just as you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment
        worth $2000, you shouldn't let anyone walk away with the time of this fellow managers.

        Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened
        by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made,
        and the actions to be taken. The minutes shoudl also be as clear and as specific
        as possible, telling the reader what is to be done, who is to do it, and when.

        Put another way, even if today's veteran manager was once an outstanding engineer,
        he is not now the technical expert he was when he joined the company.
        At Intel, anyway, we managers get a little more obsolete every day.

        For cultural values, management has to develop and nurture the common set of values,

        One was is by articulation, by spelling out these values, objectives and methods.

        There is a huge distinction between a social relationship and a communicating

        the job, but they should not be confused.

        If the absolute amount of a raise in salary is important, that person is probably
        motivated by physiological or safety/security needs. If the relative amount of a raise -
        what he got compared to others - is the important issue, that person is likely to be
        motivated by self-actualization.

        Take homosexuality for example. It's considered a disorder within the physical order.
        When we label a disorder as of being within the physical order, then there is only
        one thing that we can do: We must form a lobby. If you form a lobby, you establish
        no longer being a disorder of the physical order. As you know, homosexuality is
        no longer classified as a disorder due to the pressure of an
        aggregation of political forces.

        Where can pleasure nest? What's needed for pleasure? A body. To find pleasure we
        need a body. Even those who promise eternal bliss have to imply that the body will
        move towards it. Glorious or not, it has to be there. There needs to be a body.
        Why? Because the dimension of pleasure for a body is the dimension of descending
        to the underworld.
