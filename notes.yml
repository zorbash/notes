        Does being without a compass mean being without purpose [discours]?
        Does that make you a chaotic schizophrenic like Deleuze and Guattari claimed?

        Take homosexuality for example. It's considered a disorder within the physical order.
        When we label a disorder as of being within the physical order, then there is only
        one thing that we can do: We must form a lobby. If you form a lobby, you establish
        no longer being a disorder of the physical order. As you know, homosexuality is
        no longer classified as a disorder due to the pressure of an
        aggregation of political forces.

        The subconscious does not exist. The primal subconscious does not exist as knowledge.
        To become knowledge, to convert it into knowledge, it needs love. Lacan said that
        psychoanalysis demands loving your subconscious.

        The matter of psychically ill, or better put, of psychoses has not been addressed
        by antipsychiatry regardless of any delusions cultivated by some local groups.
        Antipsychiatry is a movement striving to free the psychiatrist.

        Where can pleasure nest? What's needed for pleasure? A body. To find pleasure we
        need a body. Even those who promise eternal bliss have to imply that the body will
        move towards it. Glorious or not, it has to be there. There needs to be a body.
        Why? Because the dimension of pleasure for a body is the dimension of descending
        to the underworld.

        is the lord himself.

        Between man and women,
        There's love.
        Between man and love,
        There's a world.
        Between man and the world,
        There's a wall.

        In order to form a healthy idea on love, one would have to start to see
        there's always castration that's at stake.

        The law of the 30th of June 1838 rules that a mentally ill person can be dangerous
        for themselves and others. It's is really odd this introduction of danger where
        social class is based. What is this danger? God knows how free one can be
        in this direction.
